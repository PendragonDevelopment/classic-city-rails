<td>I have always been drawn to computers and technology; I've been curious about how electronics work since I was a kid. I had a job doing user support for Microsoft Office for a little while in college and helped develop a website (using Drupal CMS) for another job also in college. Later on, I also worked a brief contract in IT project management. I'd been interested in building my own website for a long time, probably since four years ago but hadn't taken action to go for it. Last year, I decided to make that first step and to teach myself how to code starting with Ruby.</td>
<td>My experience with programming has been dabbling with HTML and CSS over the past few years. I also have played with a little Ruby while working on Rails applications based on the lessons in One Month Rails. I am comfortable using Terminal for literally everything and I'm using Sublime Text to write this application (because I like it, not because I think I should). I'm also really good at Googling.</td>
<td>I am familiar with Ruby on Rails. I have begun building two applications in it through One Month Rails--one is a sample app and another is my own creation which is a fake dating site.</td>

<td>Admittedly, I decided on Ruby at random. I needed to start somewhere and Ruby sounded fun. I also read a story on reddit about a guy who was a blacksmith then became a junior developer and he happened to teach himself Ruby on Rails. I thought if he could, then I could too. So far, I think I made a good choice starting with Ruby. It's fun and simple (syntax-wise) and the community around it is really great.</td>

Recently I subscribed to Code Academy and completed the HTML/CSS track and am looking forward to the Ruby track. I guess when it's all said and done I will be an excellent candidate for this workshop because I know enough to be sure I have a real interest in learning to program using ruby on rails, and I am diligent enough to keep going after the workshop is over. My goal is to transition into a rails developer within the next 6 months, as I am now looking into immersive bootcamp programs (IronYard, General Assembly, Tech Talent South).
</td>
<td>I never considered programming something I would be interested in but as I began to learn more about open source coding my interest peaked. I started learning about languages and what each does, how it works, and of course the learning curve. Because I am transitioning into development I found Ruby on Rails more interesting and it has a more practical learning curve. It also helps that the Rails community is AMAZING!

<td>App and web development sound interesting to me. I chose to learn Ruby on Rails instead of Python (a language I already have some experience with), because I had more creative ideas for app development and web design that I was able to flesh out more fully. I have many ideas that I would like to achieve with the knowledge that I gain, including starting my own websites and creating apps for others, as well as myself. </td>
<td>The workshop is obviously structured in terms of time and available activities, but how have you structured the coaching of Ruby on Rails?

I am so new to this idea that I know the basics to bring and I know the way I learn, because I have read the workshop description. However, I am sure there are questions that will turn up later. If I do come up with a good question before the workshop, can I email you? If so, where should I send the email?

<td>I use a computer everyday for work, though I spend most of my time in Microsoft applications and ERP systems. I also have a personal laptop and smartphone, which I use everyday. I understand these devices and systems on a very surface level; however, I do not know how to use them to create anything. </td>
<td>I took an introductory programming class in college. We primarily used Jython to write very simple programs and learned some basic HTML.</td>
<td>I am not familiar with Ruby on Rails, and I have never built anything with it. </td>
<td>I am hoping this workshop will be another step in determining what type of career I want. I keep exploring different fields, but nothing has felt right. I'd like to think I am a critical thinker, and I really like being put into problem solving scenarios. This workshop could be a chance to develop a new interest and better understand the tech industry.
Right now, the idea of learning to code is very intimidating and a little overwhelming. However, having people around of all skill levels and, honestly, learning with a bunch of girls makes it seem much more feasible.</td>
<td>I do not know anything about Ruby on Rails - aside from what I have researched - but it seems as if it will be a good introduction to coding. I started Codeacademy a while ago, but I think it will be nice to learn this in a group setting.</td>
<td>I know the application closed yesterday, but I just heard about the event. I would greatly appreciate the chance to participate, and thank you for the consideration!</td>

<td>Beyond editing a Myspace page and building a Dreamweaver website on Volcanos for an introductory computer science class, nope. (html/css don't count right? so actually thats a giant pile of nope.)</td>
<td>I once picked up a Rails book in the Vitamin C office and read the first chapter. And James V. tried to explain it to me a bit.</td>
<td>I'm interested in learning more about programming languages! I'm not really sure, but I'm pretty down for anything.</td>
<td>I'm very interested in learning computer programming languages, but am overwhelmed to try and teach them to myself/through a book. It'll be great to have an experienced teacher!</td>

<td>I use computers every day and can fix most problems I have. I would consider myself an intermediate/advanced user. </td>
<td>Yes, I had some courses in college in web applications and database management. However, I have definitely become less programming savvy after graduation and we only programmed using Oracle and Netbeans. I have not programmed directly in a command prompt before the Rails Girls Tutorial. </td>
<td>I am familiar with the infrastructure of the language in what it is capable enough from a theory/definition perspective. I have also attempted to do the Rails Girls Tutorial by myself. However, I am feeling a bit reluctant... mostly because I don't know exactly what I am doing and have not programmed in my command prompt before. I really hope this camp will help.</td>
<td>I think I would be a good candidate for this workshop precisely because I have ideas I would like to develop. I already have a few app ideas I would like to create and would like to expand those skills to websites as well. The mission of Rails Girls is to get more women involved in Tech and I definitely have plans to make that a reality. </td>
<td>I have several ideas that I would like to flesh out, specifically app ideas. However, that can't happen until I learn how to develop my own application. To do that, I need to know the right language. So, I have decided to learn Ruby on Rails. This coincides with my inner direction of learning how to create something and having a job centered around creation of ideas. </td>
<td>How much guided instruction is there? Is this going to be like a 2 day long meetup or is there more structure? </td>
